# Bean Around the Block

**Welcome to Bean Around the Block!**

Bean Around is a brand new caffeinated experience currently available in Vancouver and surrounding areas.

## What we do

We operating an ever increasing fleet of Coffee Delivery Trucks, which are similar to basic food trucks, and instead of a kitchen have a full coffee bar inside.

Our focus is on being a environmentally friendly and socially responsible company. As such, we only use organic and fair trade beans and compostable cups made of recycled paper products.

This website is for our customers to book services, learn about the company, and find our current location in Vancouver at any time.
